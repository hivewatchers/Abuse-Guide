# Faucet Abuse

*To utilize the free account creation system to illictly mass-produce accounts is to commit Faucet Abuse.*

The term "faucet" refers to the free accounts that Steemit Inc creates via it's flagship account @steem. These accounts are granted to new users free of charge.

When an exploiter makes hundreds of free @steem accounts, deliberately circumventing the controls that Steemit Inc put in place, they delay account creation for new users.

## Role
